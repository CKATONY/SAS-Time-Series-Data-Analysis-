# SAS-Time-Series-Data-Analysis-
We fit a __seasonal ARIMA__ model in SAS to a dataset that contains the daily temperature at 7 am in Raleigh.  
Even thougth the white noise(assumption) is partially accepted given lag 1000 and the true model could be more complicated, 
we managed to forecast the daily temerature values for the next 365 days.
